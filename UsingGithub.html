<h3>
<a id="Repository" class="anchor" href="#Repository" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Repository</h3>

<p><em>Repository</em> - Repositories are where you store each of your different projects. For example you might have one Repository called Website which contains a Website you are working on. You might also have another called Python Programs - containing (unsurprisingly!) All of your Python Programs.</p>
<p>Repositories can be created locally (on your computer) and then synchronised with GitHub so that you can work on them elsewhere by cloning and others can do this too</p>

<h3>
<a id="ThirdForm" class="anchor" href="#ThirdForm" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating a Repository (Local)</h3>

<p>The Third Form course is optional, and builds on the basics taught in the First Form. Pupils create a website using HTML and CSS, learn to write programmes to solve simple problems using Python, investigate the world of digital marketing via social media, disassemble a computer to see what is inside, and explore the realm of physical computing using a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<h3>
<a id="GCSE" class="anchor" href="#GCSE" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>GCSE</h3>

<p>At GCSE we follow the <a href="http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/gcse-computing-j275-from-2012/">OCR Computing</a> syllabus. The course introduces pupils to the fundamentals of computer programming, teaching logic, and problem-solving skills. Whilst there is a sizeable practical content, there is a requirement to learn applications of computing in industry, business and commerce.</p>

<h3>
<a id="Alevel" class="anchor" href="#ALevel" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A Level</h3>

<p>At A level the <a href="http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/as-a-level-gce-computer-science-h046-h446-from-2015/">OCR</a> course follows a natural progression from GCSE, and focuses on system production to solve problems using a programming language, and also looks at the architecture of computers, algorithms, and health and safety.</p>
