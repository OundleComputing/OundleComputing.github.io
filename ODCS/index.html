            <h1 class="red-text">Welcome to the Oundle & District Choral Society</h1>
            <h3 class="red-text">We are a mixed voice choir who have been in existence for over 100 years. We draw our membership from a fairly wide rural area and currently have approximately seventy voices who meet for rehearsals <b>every Monday during term time.</b> </h3>
            <br>
            <p>Although we are an independent choral society, we have close links with Oundle School with whom we often perform and who regularly support our concerts. Our rehearsals are held in Laxton Junior School Hall, East Road, Oundle, PE8 4BX, from
                7.30pm until 9.30pm.</p>
            <p>There is no requirement to audition and all singers are made welcome no matter what skill level you have. We are grateful to Oundle Town Council for their continuing financial support but, much like most societies, we are a registered charity
                and are obliged to charge a subscription fee. However, don’t let that stop you from coming along to see if you like us!</p>
            <p>If you are interested in joining our society please contact us for more information by telephoning/emailing using the details below. </p>

                            <p>1. What general information does Oundle & District Choral Society collect about me and how is it used? When you visit the Oundle & District Choral Society web site, we collect some basic information about your computer, such
                                as: IP address (your computer's unique signature). Operating system (e.g., Windows XP). Browser software (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer, Firefox). Internet Service Provider (e.g., Pipex, Demon, AOL, etc.) Other numeric
                                codes used to identify a computer. The information we collect is aggregated to reflect the population and not focused on individuals. We use it to help us better understand the people who visit the Oundle & District Choral
                                Society web site. In addition, like many other sites with paid advertising, we disclose some of this aggregate information to advertisers to inform them of the number of people who have seen and clicked on their links or
                                advertisements.
                            </p>
                            <p> 2. What personal information does Oundle & District Choral Society collect about me and how is it used? During the process of completing our email form, we ask you to supply personal information, including your name and an
                                e-mail address. Any information submitted is kept for our records only. It is never passed on to third parties, nor is it added to any list or used to send unsolicited e-mail or correspondence of any type.</p>
                            <p>3. How do third-party advertisers use my information? Oundle & District Choral Society does not pass on any personal information of any description to third-party advertisers. Any information we pass on is of a general nature
                                as outlined above regarding numbers of visitors, page views, etc. If you receive an email from a third party stating that it is associated with Oundle & District Choral Society, yet you do not recall asking for the information,
                                please follow the third party's removal procedures. If this procedure is not successful, please forward the e-mail with a summary of your experience to enquiries@oundlechoralsociety.org.uk. Additionally, be aware that when
                                you click on links, you may be brought to other sites not operated by Oundle & District Choral Society. You are responsible for information you provide these sites. We recommend that you review the privacy policy of any
                                site that requests personal information. </p>
                            <p>4. How may I protect my privacy on the Internet and within Oundle & District Choral Society? - Know the risks? If you provide your e-mail address to public domains such as chat rooms or newsgroups, or you provide it to web
                                sites which don't respect your privacy, you may begin to receive unsolicited e-mail. Unsolicited e-mail is also known as spam. Oundle & District Choral Society has strict rules prohibiting spam; it is generally a good idea
                                to provide your e-mail address only to people or groups that you trust. </p>
                            <p>5. Educate yourself! Look for a privacy statement on every site you visit on the Web, and search for information on how to protect your privacy. Tell your children: "Never talk to strangers!" Teach children not to give out
                                their names or other personal information. Tell them never to fill out online registration forms without your knowledge and consent. We always respect your personal privacy. We do collect information from you, but it is
